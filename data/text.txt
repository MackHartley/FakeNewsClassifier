Portuguese government officials confirmed that the man, of Angolan origin, had been deported from the UK twice before in 2014 and 2016.

Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha also claimed his first deportation happened after he served prison time for sexually abusing a child.

The Ministry of Portuguese Communities Abroad told Portuguese daily Expresso: “In 2014 he was deported to Portugal by the British authorities and assisted on his return.

“In 2016 we were made aware he had been deported again from the UK for being in the country illegally.”

The body of a notorious pedophile has been found dumped on the doorstep of the British Parliament building.

The corpse of 35-year-old Marcos Amaral Gourgel was discovered outside the UK Government building in Westminister, London.

The incident was reported to police by politicians making their way into the House of Commons from the nearby Westminister tube station.

Although it initially appeared to be a tragic accident, it was only later realized that Gourgel was a serial child abuser who was known to the British authorities.

The former model from Portugal who was found in Westminster underground station has been confirmed as 35-year-old Marcos Amaral Gourgel.

He was a regular at an emergency shelter run by central London homelessness charity The Connection.

Pam Orchard, the charity’s chief executive, said: “These tragic deaths are not just statistics. Everyone who is homeless is someone’s son or brother or dad.”

Scotland Yard said the death is being treated as unexplained, but not suspicious.

Scotland Yard and the Home Office were unable to comment on the allegations of child sex offences.
